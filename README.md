# Program_Evaluation

This repository contains the homework to [Program Evaluation](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/programs-degrees/courses/program-evaluation).

This is a required class as a part of my [MSCAPP](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) degree at the University of Chicago.

You can find full assignment solutions as well as the assignments themselves in each of the folders above.

This repo is meant to serve as additional evidence of my abilities to employ econometrics methods with proficiency in Python.

I scored close to 100% on all assignments.
